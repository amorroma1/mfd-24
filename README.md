A 24-hour instrument dial for people who stand watches — pilots, mariners, UAV crews, duty
officers. One turn of the hour hand per day, your shift drawn as an arc of that day, a dead-man's
monitor that escalates to SOS and leaves a record, and the telemetry a watch actually runs on.

Everything works offline except the weather. No companion app, no account, no analytics. GPL.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **24-hour dial** | One revolution per day. Noon up or midnight up. Minutes on their own ring; the second is a cursor that steps, so nothing sweeps. |
| **Watch timer** | Start now or book ahead. An arc spans the hours on duty and dims as they are served; `DUTY: 04:40 REM` counts down. Both boundaries beep and buzz with the screen off. A finished watch clears itself an hour later. |
| **Vigilance monitor** | Off by default. Every 5/10/15 min it wants a sign of life; thirty seconds later it sounds SOS in bursts and leaves `MAN DOWN` with the Zulu moment on the dial. Optional: your pulse during the missed check, against your last moving reading. |
| **Zulu + date-time group** | `Z 22AUG 12:16:13`, the clock a log entry is written in. |
| **Weather** | Temperature, METAR-style condition and QNH. At an aerodrome it is that field's **own METAR**; everywhere else Open-Meteo. Refreshed every 30 minutes. |
| **5 km site lock** | Names the nearest airfield, port, heliport or spaceport from 9,649 sites in a 194 KB on-device index. Military sites are drawn in the accent colour. |
| **Nadir, sun and moon** | Daylight shaded across the hour band, computed offline. The sun and the moon sit at their true hour angles — point a mark at the real thing and the dial is a **compass**. The moon carries its honest phase. |
| **Sensor slots** | Two optional readouts beside the hub: heart rate, the platform's own daily step total, or station pressure. Off by default; they run only while the screen is on. |
| **Always-on** | The same dial, dimmed. `AUTO` thins it to every other pixel after sunset — never during a night watch. |
| **Direct boot** | Draws populated before the watch is unlocked. |

## In action

| A missed check, answered late | Crossing time zones | Waking |
|---|---|---|
| ![](docs/media/mandown.gif) | ![](docs/media/glide.gif) | ![](docs/media/wake.gif) |
| The SOS went unanswered: `MAN DOWN`, the Zulu moment, a mark on the arc. One tap answers with `TAP AGAIN`; a second, inside a second, clears it — a sleeve cannot. | The hour scale glides the short way round the day; the minute hand only takes what is left inside the hour. Remaining duty time never changes. | Only the light arrives. Always-on wears the same hues, so there is nothing to cross-fade. |

## Install

Download `app-earth-release.apk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/amorroma1/mfd-24/releases/latest) and sideload it. Wear OS
has no sideloading UI, so this is an ADB job:

```
adb connect 192.168.1.50:41234
adb install -r app-earth-release.apk
```

Then pick MFD-24 in the watch's own face picker.

<details>
<summary><b>Updates, and why this is not on Google Play</b></summary>

<br>

The watch checks GitHub **once a day, off duty**, and tells you once per release. It downloads
nothing and installs nothing: **Wear OS does not let an app install an app** (verified on a TicWatch
Pro 3 Ultra). `ABOUT → RELEASES` shows the release page as a QR code for a phone camera, and the
install stays `adb install -r`. `ABOUT → RELEASE CHECK` turns the whole thing off.

It is not on Google Play on purpose: a dead-man's monitor should not be an impulse install, the
permissions it legitimately needs keep a hobby project in permanent store review, and an APK with
its SHA-256 in the release notes is more verifiable than a listing. Full reasoning in
[INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#why-mfd-24-is-not-on-google-play).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b id="permissions">Permissions — nothing is requested at install time</b></summary>

<br>

Location is asked for from the settings screen, because a watch face is a `WallpaperService` and
cannot raise a dialog itself.

| Permission | For | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | weather, Nadir, the site lock | those three are blank; the clock and the astronomy are unaffected |
| `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` | the same, from the 30-minute refresh job | the platform returns null rather than an error, which looks exactly like no signal |
| `WAKE_LOCK`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_HEALTH` | the vigilance monitor, which must keep sensing with the screen off | that feature only |
| `VIBRATE` | shift boundaries and the SOS | silent boundaries |
| `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` | boundaries landing on the minute | requested but **not** required; without it a boundary can slip a few minutes |
| `INTERNET` | Open-Meteo and METAR every 30 min, plus the daily release check | no weather, no release check |
| `BODY_SENSORS` | the heart-rate slot and the pulse in an incident | dashes; the `LOG PULSE` row is not offered |
| `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` | the steps slot; on Wear 5+ also what lets the vigilance service start | dashes; on newer Wear, no vigilance |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | the monitor's ongoing notice, and the once-per-release update notice | the monitor runs unannounced |

No contacts, no storage, and no network beyond those calls. A hand-typed position replaces location
entirely — see **Position** in the settings.

## Settings

**Long-press the face, then tap the pencil.** Seven collapsible sections, one open at a time; the
open one is outlined.

| Sections | Duty control | Scheduling | Display | About |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ![](docs/screenshots/settings-sections.png) | ![](docs/screenshots/settings-duty.png) | ![](docs/screenshots/settings-schedule.png) | ![](docs/screenshots/settings-display.png) | ![](docs/screenshots/settings-about.png) |

- **Duty control** — duration `4h` `8h` `12h` `CST`, a booked start, and one chip reading
  `START NOW` or a terracotta `END DUTY`. A start in the past cannot be booked.
- **Vigilance** — on/off, check interval, `VIBE STRENGTH`, `SOS SOUND` (OFF/LOW/MED/HIGH),
  `LOG PULSE`, and the incident log with its export.
- **Sensors** — what each hub slot reads.
- **Position** — automatic, or coordinates typed by hand.
- **Display** — palette, dial top, midnight mark, Nadir, sun and moon marks, weather, always-on,
  and `HINTS` for the small print under each row.
- **Units** — °C/°F, hPa/mmHg.
- **About** — version, the repository as a QR, the release check.

## The dial, in detail

| ![](docs/screenshots/duty.png) | ![](docs/screenshots/ambient-auto.png) | ![](docs/screenshots/ambient-duty.png) |
|---|---|---|
| Mid-watch: the arc is the shift, the bright part is what is left to serve. | `ALWAYS-ON > AUTO` thins the face after sunset — half the light, half the burn-in duty cycle. | A running watch keeps the full face all night: a night duty is exactly when the dial is read in the dark. |

## MFD-24-Mars

The same instrument, one planet over: a separate face that installs **beside** MFD-24 and keeps a
rover's time instead of yours. Built for the operators and the incurably curious — Mars has no
time zones, no METAR and no moon worth marking, so the dial carries what a rover's day actually
runs on.

| Perseverance, sol 1959, midnight up |
|---|
| ![](docs/screenshots/mars.png) |

*Captured on the watch, on charge, with live ephemerides. The hour hand runs the rover's own
**Local Mean Solar Time** — a sol is 24 h 39 m 35 s, and the scale stretches with it. The shaded
band is that sol's daylight with −6° twilight shoulders, and the hand's tip is the sun's place on
its daily arc: it enters the band at the moment of physical sunrise and leaves it at physical
sunset, which is why there is no separate sun mark.*

<details>
<summary><b>Why the hour hand is the sun — the arithmetic, for the incurably curious</b></summary>

<br>

The dial keeps the rover's Local Mean Solar Time, from the Mars Sol Date:

```
MSD  = (JD_TT − 2451549.5) / 1.0274912517 + 44796 − 0.0009626
MTC  = 24 h × frac(MSD)                      mean solar time at Mars's 0° meridian
LMST = MTC + λE / 15                         λE — the rover's east longitude, degrees
```

The hour hand's angle is the linear map `θ(t) = LMST(t) / 24 × 360°`, and the daylight band's
edges are **the same map applied to the sunrise and sunset instants**. Substitute `t = t_rise`
and the two expressions coincide — the hand stands on the dawn edge at the moment of physical
sunrise not approximately but by construction, to the accuracy of the underlying model
(Allison & McEwen 2000, good to seconds).

The same identity is the proof that a separate sun dot cannot exist on this dial. Any mark that
touches the dawn edge at sunrise, touches the dusk edge at sunset, and moves continuously
between them is forced, by the linearity of the same map, to coincide with the hand at every
instant — it could only restate the hand. The *true* sun does differ from the hand, by Mars's
equation of time,

```
EOT = 2.861° sin 2Ls − 0.071° sin 4Ls + 0.002° sin 6Ls − (ν − M)      ≈ ±50 min over a Mars year
```

— but a true-sun dot then misses the band's edges by exactly that amount at the horizons,
because the band lives in mean time. One of the two pictures had to be chosen, and this dial
chose the one whose geometry closes. The twilight shoulders are the same construction, six
degrees lower.

</details>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rover clock** | `PERSEVERANCE` or `CURIOSITY` in the editor. The dial, the daylight, the comm windows and the mission sol all follow the choice — and switching glides the whole dial the short way round the sol, exactly the way the Earth face crosses a time zone. |
| **Mars daylight** | Sunrise, sunset and twilight from the Allison & McEwen (2000) chain, the algorithm NASA's Mars24 clock runs. Mars's eccentric orbit swings its equation of time through ±50 minutes; no Earth arithmetic would do. |
| **Direct-to-Earth line** | The inner edge of the tick ring marks when Earth stands above 10° at the rover — pure celestial mechanics, computed offline. In solar conjunction the line thins to a hairline and the readout flies `CONJ`: the geometry holds, the corona is in the way. |
| **Relay line** | The outer edge marks orbiter passes over the rover — MRO, Odyssey, MAVEN and TGO, each switchable — from JPL Horizons ephemerides fetched six-hourly and cached per site. Each orbiter stands or falls on its own: MAVEN's published trajectory currently ends in March 2026, so it contributes nothing and says so rather than being quietly dropped. When none can be had the face flies `NO EPHEMERIS` rather than drawing an empty sky. |
| **Light time** | `SOL 4994` and, behind a ground-station dish, `15:42` — the one-way light time to Earth in real minutes and seconds, live. |

**Both comm lines are a view from Mars, taken from the rover's own point on it: where Earth and
where the orbiters stand in *that* sky, above *that* horizon.** They are windows of visibility and
nothing more. They do not know whether a Deep Space Network antenna is booked for the pass, whether
the orbiter has a relay session planned over the site, what the rover's power and thermal budget
allow, or what the skyline actually looks like from inside a crater — the horizon is taken as flat
and the threshold as a plain 10°. So the line says *the geometry allows it*, which is the half of
the question a watch on a wrist can answer honestly and offline; the other half lives in mission
planning, changes daily, and is not published in any form a dial could trust.

Everything else — the duty arc (moved inside, onto the hour hand's point), the vigilance monitor,
the incident record — works unchanged, in the rover's own time. What it deliberately lacks:
weather, the site lock, both sky marks and the unit rows — a rover has no METAR, Earth's moon is
not in its sky, and on a mean-time dial the only sun that touches the band's edges at the real
sunrise and sunset is the hour hand itself.

Build it from the same tree — `./gradlew :app:assembleMarsRelease` produces
`app-mars-release.apk` — and sideload it exactly like the Earth face.

<details>
<summary><b>Footnotes — the step count, the hardware it needs, and what it weighs</b></summary>

<br>

**How the step count is arrived at.** The row prefers the platform's own daily figure, through
Health Services, because that is the number the rest of the watch agrees with and it does not care
when this face was installed. Where a watch has no such provider, or the provider binds and then
says nothing, the face counts for itself from the hardware step counter. That fallback is exact
**from the next local midnight onward**, because the counter's value is recorded at the day
boundary; on the day you install it, it can only count from the moment you switch the slot on, and
it shows dashes rather than a `0` it would have invented. One watch tested here reports its "daily"
total as steps since the subscription began rather than since midnight — a provider quirk, not a
setting, and the reason the row is worth reading as *steps counted*, not as a fitness statistic.

**Screen.** Round, and tested at **454 × 454**. Every position on the dial is a fraction of the
radius, so other round sizes should be fine; square and chin-cut screens are not designed for and
will crop the outer scale. Text is sized from the radius too — the readout width budget is
arithmetic and there is a test that fails if a row would reach the hour numerals.

**Hardware and performance.** Wear OS 3.0+ (API 30), any watch the platform runs on; no GPU
features beyond an ordinary canvas. `render()` allocates nothing, so there is no garbage collector
pause to schedule around, and the frame rate is demand-driven: **one frame a second at rest**,
16 ms only while a transition is animating, and one frame a minute in always-on. The optional
sensors are the only real cost — heart rate is an LED, and the vigilance monitor keeps the
accelerometer batching in the sensor hub rather than waking the processor. Everything else runs off
cached values.

**Size.** About **3.5 MB** installed, of which roughly 2.8 MB is code, 190 KB the on-device site
index and 220 KB the picker preview. The index is stored uncompressed on purpose so it can be read
without unpacking. English resources only: the app's own text is English, and carrying eighty
locales of library strings it can never display cost 260 KB.

</details>

## What it is not

A personal instrument, not a certified one. The vigilance monitor is an uncertified aid: it can be
switched off, suspended by a loose strap, or delayed by the platform's own doze limits. The incident
log covers **one watch** — starting another empties it, so anything worth keeping leaves via
`EXPORT LOG` first. Nothing here substitutes for a device a regulator has approved.

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/amorroma1/mfd-24.git
cd mfd-24
./gradlew :app:assembleEarthDebug
```

JDK 17+ and the Android SDK. 178 JVM tests: `./gradlew :app:testEarthDebugUnitTest`.

## How it was built

Designed, decided and worn by one person, written with Claude (Anthropic) as a pair-programmer.
Every constant that could be measured was measured on the watch rather than reasoned about, every
invariant is pinned by a test, and nothing ships that has not run on the wrist. The working notes
in `CLAUDE.md` are the record of that collaboration and stay in the repository on purpose.
