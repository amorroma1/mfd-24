/**
 * The locked aerodrome's own METAR, from aviationweather.gov.
 *
 * When the site lock names an airfield, the most authoritative weather on the dial is that
 * field's own observation — the one its tower reads out — not a forecast model's cell that
 * happens to contain it. The API needs no key, answers in JSON so no METAR grammar lives here,
 * and the row's format does not change at all: it was drawn in METAR abbreviations from the
 * start, so this is the row becoming literally what it already looked like.
 *
 * Strictly a refinement, never a dependency: any miss — no METAR at that field, a stale one, a
 * null temperature, a closed feed — returns null and the caller falls back to Open-Meteo. That
 * fallback is not a corner case: most of the 9 649 sites never had a METAR, and whole regions
 * stop publishing in wartime, the user's own included.
