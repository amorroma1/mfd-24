/**
 * Resolved colours for one (palette, planet) combination.
 *
 * A [Palette] is rebuilt only when the user style changes, never per frame — the renderer reads the
 * plain `Int` fields directly.
 *
 * ### Three hues, none of them containing blue
 * Blue is by a wide margin the shortest-lived emitter in an OLED stack, and always-on holds the same
 * image for hours, so a face with blue in it is a face that ages its own panel. Rather than keep a
 * separate blue-free palette for always-on and cross-fade between the two on waking, the whole
 * palette is blue-free and always-on is simply **the same hue, dimmer**. Nothing changes colour when
 * the watch wakes; only the brightness comes up.
 *
 * That is why there is no white here. Cockpit White was mostly blue, which made it exactly the wrong
 * thing to leave on screen all night.

     * blue-free hues; a palette spends two of them, on the dial and on the accent; the mark takes
