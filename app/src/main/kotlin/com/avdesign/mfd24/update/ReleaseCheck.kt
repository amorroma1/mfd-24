/**
 * Asks GitHub what the latest release of this face is.
 *
 * The releases page is the product's only distribution channel — there is no store listing on
 * purpose (the README says why) — so "is there an update" has one authoritative answer: the
 * repository's release list. The *list*, not `releases/latest`: GitHub's "latest" is one release
 * per repository, and with two faces publishing, whichever shipped most recently would hide the
 * other's newest from its own updater for good. One request, no token, no library: the same bare
 * `HttpURLConnection` + platform `org.json` shape as `MetarClient` and `OpenMeteoClient`.
 *
 * The faces share the repository but not the releases: each flavor carries its tag prefix and
 * asset name in `BuildConfig`, filters the list to its own, and takes the highest version — by
 * numeric compare, not list order, because a re-published release floats on `created_at`. The
 * Earth face therefore never offers itself a Mars build, and neither face can eclipse the other.
