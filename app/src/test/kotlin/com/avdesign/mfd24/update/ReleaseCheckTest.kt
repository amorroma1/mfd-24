/**
 * The update decision, pinned.
 *
 * Four ways this ends in the wrong install prompt: a string version compare (`2.10.0` sorts
 * below `2.9.1` and the face never sees the update), a parse that takes the wrong flavor's
 * asset (an Earth watch offered a Mars build the platform would refuse *after* the download),
 * a release with no APK treated as installable, and — the reason the check reads the release
 * *list* — GitHub's repo-global `latest`, which would let whichever face shipped most recently
 * hide the other's newest from its own updater for good. The payloads here are the real shape
 * of GitHub's `releases` response, trimmed to the fields the parser is allowed to rely on.
