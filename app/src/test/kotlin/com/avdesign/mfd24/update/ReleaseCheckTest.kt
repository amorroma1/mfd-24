/**
 * The update decision, pinned.
 *
 * Three ways this ends in the wrong install prompt: a string version compare (`2.10.0` sorts
 * below `2.9.1` and the face never sees the update), a parse that takes the wrong flavor's asset
 * (an Earth watch offered a Mars build the platform would refuse *after* the download), and a
 * release with no APK treated as installable. The payload here is the real shape of GitHub's
 * `releases/latest` response, trimmed to the fields the parser is allowed to rely on.
