// The POI binary asset is produced by the :tools:poi generator from the CSV sources in
// tools/poi/data. It lands in a generated assets dir rather than being committed, so the .bin can
// never drift from the CSVs.
//
// The task declares its output as a DirectoryProperty so that AGP's own
// `addGeneratedSourceDirectory` can wire it into the variant below. That API is the only one that
// gets both halves of the job right at once. `assets.srcDir(...)` packages the directory but
// carries no task dependency, which is why this used to need a hand-written `dependsOn` on every
// merge*Assets task -- and why `assembleRelease` still failed in the lint model task, which reads
// the same directory and was never in that list. Handing `srcDir` the TaskProvider or a
// `files(...).builtBy(...)` instead is worse than either: the build goes green and poi_v1.bin is
// quietly left out of the APK.
